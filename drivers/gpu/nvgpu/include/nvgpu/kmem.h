 * Kmem cache support
 * ------------------
 *
 * In Linux there is support for the notion of a kmem_cache. It gives better
 * memory usage characteristics for lots of allocations of the same size. Think
 * structs that get allocated over and over. Normal kmalloc() type routines
 * typically round to the next power-of-2 since that's easy.
 *
 * But if we know the size ahead of time the packing for the allocations can be
 * much better. This is the benefit of a slab allocator. This type hides the
 * underlying kmem_cache (or absense thereof).
