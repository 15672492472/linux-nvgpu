/**
 * @file
 * @page unit-init Unit Init
 *
 * Overview
 * ========
 *
 * The Init unit is called by OS (QNX, Linux) to initialize or teardown the
 * driver. The Init unit ensures all the other sub-units are initialized so the
 * driver is able to provide general functionality to the application.
 *
 * Static Design
 * =============
 *
 * HAL Initialization
 * ------------------
 * The HAL must be initialized before the nvgpu_finalize_poweron() is called.
 * This is accomplished by calling nvgpu_detect_chip() which will determine
 * which GPU is in the system and configure the HAL interfaces.
 *
 * Common Initialization
 * ---------------------
 * The main driver initialization occurs by calling nvgpu_finalize_poweron()
 * which will initialize all of the common units in the driver and must be done
 * before the driver is ready to provide full functionality.
 *
 * Common Teardown
 * ---------------
 * If the GPU is unused, the driver can be torn down by calling
 * nvgpu_prepare_poweroff().
 *
 * External APIs
 * -------------
 * + nvgpu_detect_chip() - Called to initialize the HAL.
 * + nvgpu_finalize_poweron() - Called to initialize nvgpu driver.
 * + nvgpu_prepare_poweroff() - Called before powering off GPU HW.
 * + nvgpu_init_gpu_characteristics() - Called during HAL init for enable flag
 * processing.
 *
 * Dynamic Design
 * ==============
 * After initialization, the Init unit provides a number of APIs to track state
 * and usage count.
 *
 * External APIs
 * -------------
 * + nvgpu_get() / nvgpu_put() - Maintains ref count for usage.
 * + nvgpu_can_busy() - Check to make sure driver is ready to go busy.
 * + nvgpu_check_gpu_state() - Restart if the state is invalid.
