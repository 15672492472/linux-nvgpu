 * to OS. On Linux wee don't want to BUG() for general driver misbehaving. BUG()
 * is a very heavy handed tool - in fact there's probably no where within the
 * nvgpu core code where it makes sense to use a BUG() when running under Linux.
 *
 * However, on QNX (and POSIX) BUG() will just kill the current process. This
 * means we can use it for handling bugs in nvgpu.
 *
 * As a result this macro varies depending on platform.
