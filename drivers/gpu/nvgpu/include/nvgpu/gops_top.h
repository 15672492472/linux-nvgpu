	/**
	 * @brief Get all the engine related information from device_info table
	 *
	 * @param g [in]		GPU device struct pointer
	 * @param dev_info [out]	Pointer to device information struct
	 *				which gets populated with all the
	 *				engine related information.
	 * @param engine_type [in]	Engine enumeration value
	 * @param inst_id [in]		Engine's instance identification number
	 *
	 * 1. Device_info table is an array of registers which contains engine
	 *    specific data like interrupt enum, reset enum, pri_base etc.
	 * 2. This HAL reads such engine information from table after matching
	 *    the \a engine_type and \a inst_id and then populates the read
	 *    information in \a dev_info struct.
	 * 3. In the device_info table, more than one register is required to
	 *    denote information for a specific engine. So they use multiple
	 *    consecutive registers in the array to represent a specific engine.
	 * 4. The MSB (called chain bit) in each register denotes if the next
	 *    register talks the same engine as present the one. All the
	 *    registers in the device info table can be classified in one of 4
	 *    types:
	 *      - Not_valid: We ignore these registers
	 *      - Data: This type of register contains pri_base, fault_id etc
	 *      - Enum: This type of register contains intr_enum, reset_enum
	 *      - Engine_type: This type of register contains the engine name
	 *               which is being described.
	 * 5. So, in the parsing code,
	 * 	- We loop through the array
	 * 	- Ignore the invalid entries
	 * 	- Store the “linked” register values in temporary variables
	 *	   until chain_bit is set. This helps us get all the data for
	 *	   particular engine type. [This is needed because the engine
	 *         name may not be part of the first register representing the
	 *	   engine. So we can’t just read the first register and
	 *	   determine if the group represents the engine we are
	 *         interested in]. Once the chain_bit is disabled, we know the
	 *         next register read would represent a new engine.
	 * 	- So we parse the stored variables to get engine_name,
	 *         intr/reset_enums, pri base etc. Here we check if the engine
	 *    	   type is the one we are interested in.
	 *
